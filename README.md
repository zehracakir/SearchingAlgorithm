# Searching Algorithm
## Binary Search 
* The binary search algorithm assumes that the data array we have is ordered, and it wants to reach a conclusion by changing this situation.
* It searches by dividing the array into two at a time.
* Big o = logn -> O(logn)
## Linear Search
* It finds the desired element by browsing through individual elements.
* Does not use extra memory.
* Big o = n -> O(n)
